    <p class="desc">I am passionate about my work.
        Every employer seeks to hire people who enjoy their work, but the word “passion” evokes feelings of dedication
        and loyalty. When someone is passionate about the work they’re doing, they’re naturally committed to quality and
        positive outcomes.

        Example: “I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that
        drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that
        helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our
        photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.”

        I am ambitious and driven.
        Ambition and drive are two qualities that are essential to success and growth in many jobs. When an employer
        hires an ambitious candidate, they can rest assured this new hire will consistently seek ways to improve
        themselves and keep their eyes firmly set on their next goal.

        Example: “I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have
        something to strive towards. I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do
        better and achieve greatness. In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years.”

        I am highly organised.
        An organised candidate is a detail-oriented candidate and someone an employer can trust to meet deadlines. This
        quality is especially important in administrative positions, project management and other roles that require
        adherence to process and quality.

        Example: “I am highly organised. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of
        deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I’m always able to find what I
        need. I find this increases efficiency and also helps the rest of the team stay on track. In my last role, I
        created a new filing process that increased departmental efficiency by 25 percent.”
